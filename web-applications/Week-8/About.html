    <h2>About Sheldon's Game Shelf</h2>
    <p>This site is the submission for my final project for SWDV 620 through Maryville University taught by Professor Rodney W. McGee Jr. I decided to use part of my board game collection and make my own review site including infroamtion such as the publisher, player count, recommended ages, and a link to the respective BGG page. There is also a list of upcoming games I am excited about with information including publisher, player count, recommended ages, estimated retail dates, and relevant links.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Sheldon Mattson. I am 28 years old and have been playing board games over the past few years, mostly with my girlfriend of 11 years Emily. We have a dog named Boomer and currently live in Iowa where we both work at the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Lab. I graduated from Iowa State University with a Bachelor's in Animal Science and am currently pursuing a Masters in Software Development from Maryville University.</p>
    <p>My favorite movie of all time is Jurassic Park and my favorite book is <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/290255/taggerung-by-brian-jacques-illustrated-by-gary-chalk/">Taggerung</a> by Brian Jaques. I am a fan of Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and all things Disney. I enjoy playing Magic the Gathering and Dungeons and Dragons with Emily and friends in my free time and spending time with Boomer. </p>
