        <h3>Abyss</h3>
        <p>I was pulled to this game because of the artwork which is absolutely gorgeous. I always enjoy playing Abyss and it is a group favorite as many games can be very competitive or aggresive whereas this game is more strategy. I feel like the Kraken expansion adds some fun changes whereas the Leviathan expansion does not contribute as much outside of the new Lords.<br></p>
        <p>Highly recommend for anyone looking for a game of strategy with gorgeous artwork.</p>

        <h3>Ashes: Rise of the Phoenixborn</h3>
        <p>Ashes is another game that drew me in because of the artwork. The artwork is amazing and the cards are very well desgined. It is a competitive card game that has fallen to the wayside for my playgroup. It is highly strategic and as such games can sometimes taka while and feel stagnate. A year or so ago the game was "cancelled" but the end of last year or early this year it was "reborn" with rebalanced cards and updated rules. Not sure if the changes would make any difference. We play occassionally but there are many other games we would play over Ashes.<br></p>
        <p>If strategic card games are your thing this might be a game for you. Amazing artwork.</p>

        <h3>Betrayal at House on the Hill</h3>
        <p>Betrayal at House on the Hill is another frequently played game. The premise is each player has a different character and you explore a "haunted house" using randomly drawn room tiles depending on which floor you are on. This can result in finding items, omens, or events happenning and every game is a different house. There is a slight luck element in dice rolling but for most instances outside of the haunt roll they can be mitigated with cards. The "haunt" starts when a player rolls less than the amount of obtained omens and the scenario is dependent on who rolled, the omen, and the room. With all of these different random elements and a large list of possible scenarios (100+ with expansions) the game as a large amount of variety. Betrayal is one of my favorites: it is fun and the fact no two games are the same keeps me coming back for more.<br></p>
        <p>Highly recommend this for groups who usually have up to 6 players and are looking for a game with high replayability. There is also a <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/228660/betrayal-baldurs-gate">Betrayal at Baldur's Gate</a> standalone for any Dungeons and Dragons fans.</p>

        <h3>Direwild</h3>
        <p>Direwild has awesome artwork and the creatures have great names with witty flavor text. Part of the fun is "combining" all of the creatures you played each turn into one and reading the overall creature "description". It is a unique combination of deck-building and dungeon crawling and I bought the kickstarter edition with cool miniatures. Unfortunately this game takes a long time to set up, uses plenty of table space, and has some balance issues. We love playing it and some friends are always asking to to play it but the time and space constraints are sometimes the deciding factor. We also tend to have 5-6 people over to play at which point it is not an option.<br></p>
        <p>Fun game if you have the space, time, and are willing to put up with any issues or use house rules.</p>

        <h3>Disney Villainous</h3>
        <p>Villainous is a play group and personal favorite. The different character goals, boards, and decks are thematically on point and the game receives frequent support in expansions. There are about 15 total villains that can be played and the game has expanded into a Marvel version with its own first expansion coming out. Some characters are a little more balanced than others, but the game allows for strategically discarding over and over to help make up for any issues. While the game does recommend 2-6 players it does work with more, albeit much slower games that can showcase any balance issues. It is always fun to be Prince John and play "beautiful lovely taxes" or play Hercules to Hades board.<br></p>
        <p>A fun game with a little bit of strategy and heavy on theme. Recommend for any disney lovers.</p>

        <h3>Sorcerer City</h3>
        <p>Sorcerer City seems daunting at first with a lot of setup required, table space necessary, and many different parts to learn. It is a highly strategic tile laying game and the time crunch can be intense. However, after learning it is extremely fun and rewarding and plays at a surprisingly quick pace due to everyone building at the same time. I personally love playing it and despite friend sbeing skeptical at first they have all been left wanting to play more.<br></p>
        <p>If you have the space and are willing to learn this is a must have game.</p>

        <h3>Trial by Trolley</h3>
        <p>This is a fun game to play. It is a light party game that is a frequent go to due to its large player count. There is a large luck of the draw aspect as to cards that make sense with scenarios and arguments can sometimes get heated. Great casual game overall that is always fun to play with friends.<br></p>
        <p>Looking for a good party game full of laughs and outlandish dilemnas, this is the game for you.</p>

        <h3>Unstable Unicorns</h3>
        <p>Unstable Unicorns was one of the first games we bought and has been a group staple ever since. The cards are witty and have a wide variety so games are always different. There are tons of expansions that add new elements so the game has lots of support. With so many expansions the overall deck can get bogged down so i would recommend multiple copies of the base game with one or two expansions mixed in. Overall myself and everyone that we have played with loves Unstable Unicorns and its expansions. We love it so much that any TeeTurtle release is an instant buy (Runes and Regulations, Here to Slay).<br></p>
        <p>Looking for a fun casual game that has hilarious cards? I highly recommend this game.</p>
