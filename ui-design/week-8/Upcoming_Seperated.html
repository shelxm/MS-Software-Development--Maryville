            <h2>Jurassic World Miniature Game</h2>
            <p>Jurassic Park is my favorite movie of all time so anything related to the IP is a must, add in some awesome looking miniatures and it was a no brainer to "spare no expense". To be honest I have no clue how gameplay will be, I ourely bought it for the aforementioned reasons. Unfortunately this game is in flux more than most. Just recently an update explained the reasons included some reorganization at the game company and most importantly changes with Universal requiring game changes and embargos. The reasons for this are restrucutring due to COVID and the upcoming Jurassic World movie so some changes to algin with it. Expected to ship in 2-3 waves starting later this year or beginning of next.</p>

            <h2>Oathsworn: Into the Deepwood</h2>
            <p>Oathsworn is a co-operative dark fantasy campaign board game. There is tons of content, awesome looking miniatures, and it sounds like it will be an epic game. Demand is high with a waitlist as it is Kickstart exclusive, beyond stores that purchased from the kickstarter, with many people asking on Facebook how to get in on it. My only worry is time and space constraints as to how often I will be able to play. Aside from the waitlist it is available to preorder from <a href="https://tgg-games.com/products/oathsworn">The Gaming Goat</a>. I think it is still slated for shipping around November.</p>

            <h2>Dinosaur World</h2>
            <p>Dinosaur World looks like Jurassic Park in board game form, which is my favorite IP. Build your own park, roll dice to determine any casualties from jeep tours, and managing your dinosaurs. What else can I say? Super excited for this game, especially as its predecessor Dinosaur Island was highly rated online. Supposed to start shipping around September.</p>

            <h2>Transformers Deck-Building Game</h2>
            <p>Deck-building games are a favorite of mine, especially when it implements some of my favorite IPs well. As such, I am excited about this game from both the Transformers IP and the style of game. No information yet besides its announcement so I will hold judgement until I see how it works but it comes from Renegade Game Studios who have a solid history of games including Clank!.</p>

            <h2>Ascension: Curse of the Golden Isles</h2>
            <p>Curse of the Golden Isles is the latest Ascension expansion, all of which can be standalone or combined with others. They all follow the same basic principles with new mechanics and cards introduced into each one which provides a refreshing variety. We have Skulls and Sails so having the two expansions combine well (thematically and mechanically) sounds awesome. Ascension always has great artwork and is tons of fun.</p>
