    <h2>Upcoming Games</h2>
    <p>Below are some upcoming games that I am excited about.</p>
    <div class="games">
        <h3>Jurassic World Miniature Game</h3>
        <p>I am a sucker for a game with amazing miniatures and add in official Jurassic Park IP and it was no brainer for me to "spare no expense". Current Kickstarter updates say "this summer" for the core game with expansions and add-ons sometime next year.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Publisher: Exod Games</li>
            <li>Player Count: 2 to X players</li>
            <li>Ages: 14+</li>
            <li>Retail Release: TBD</li>

    <div class="games">
        <h3>Oathsworn: Into the Deepwood</h3>
        <p>Oathsworn is a co-operative dark fantasy campaign board game. There is tons of content, awesome miniatures, and it sounds like it will be an epic game. My only worry is time and space constraints as to how often I will be able to play.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Publisher: Shadowborne Games</li>
            <li>Player Count: 1-4</li>
            <li>Ages: 14+</li>
            <li>Retail release: N/A Kickstarter exclusive</li>

    <div class="games">
        <h3>Dinosaur World</h3>
        <p>Dinosaur World looks like Jurassic Park in board game form. Build your own park, rolling dice to determine any casualties from jeep tours, and managing your dinosaurs. What else can I say? Super excited for this game, especially as its predecessor Dinosaur Island was highly rated online.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Publisher: Pandasaurus</li>
            <li>Player count: 1-4 players</li>
            <li>Ages: 10+</li>
            <li>Retail Release: Summer 2021</li>

    <div class="games">
        <h3>Transformers Deck-Building Game</h3>
        <p>Deck-building games are a favorite of mine, especially when it implements some of my favorite IPs well. As such, I am excited about this game from both the Transformers IP and the style of game. No information yet besides its announcement so I will hold judgement until I see how it works but it comes from Renegade Game Studios who have a solid history of games including Clank!.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Publisher: Renegade Game Studios</li>
            <li>Player Count: 1-5 players</li>
            <li>Ages: 13+</li>
            <li>Retail Release: July 2021</li>

        <h3>Ascension: Curse of the Golden Isles</h3>
        <p>Curse of the Golden Isles is the latest Ascension expansion, all of which can be standalone or combined with others. They all follow the same basic principles with new mechanics and cards introduced into each one which provides a refreshing variety. We have Skulls and Sails so having the two expansions combine well (thematically and mechanically) sounds awesome. Ascension always has great artwork and is tons of fun.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stoneblade Entertainment</li>
            <li>Player count: 2 to 4 players (2-6 with Ascension: Skulls and Sails)</li>
            <li>Ages: 13+</li>
            <li>Retail Release: July 2021</li>
